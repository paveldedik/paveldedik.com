    <p>
      I am currently located in Brno, Czech Republic, working as a Software Engineer. 
      I mainly focus on Python and Rust ecosystems, but I also like to work with Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform and CI. 
      My main ambition is to improve <em>developer experience</em> in products to make software engineers in companies happier.
