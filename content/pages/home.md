# About

I am currently located in Brno, Czech Republic, working as a Senior Platform Engineer at [Kiwi.com](https://kiwi.com/), a flight ticket search engine.

Previously I worked as a CTO at [Mergado](https://www.mergado.cz) leading the development of a web service that helps shoppers promote their products on Heureka.cz, Zboží.cz, Google Merchant and other popular online shopping services.

Between 2010 to 2015 I studied computer science at the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno. I focused mainly on web development, machine learning, educational systems and other stuff more or less related to computer science and mathematics. For a time I was also a member of the [Studio of Graphic Design and Multimedia](https://www.fi.muni.cz/research/laboratories/agdm.html.en) and the [Adaptive Learning](https://www.fi.muni.cz/adaptivelearning/) research group.
